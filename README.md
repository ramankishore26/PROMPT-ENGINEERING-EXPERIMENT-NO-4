Aim: To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts. Case study 2 with Comparative Analysis Prompt, Universal Prompt, Structures Prompt Refinements and Prompt Size Limitations


Explanation - Any one use case from Unit 5 and generate the report for that with the unit 2 Prompt type


Developing an AI-based predictive maintenance system for manufacturing equipment involves using scenario-based report development techniques—including comparative analysis prompts and understanding prompt size limitations—to effectively guide experiments, analyze data, and report outcomes.[1][2][3]

## Scenario-Based Prompting Techniques

Scenario-based prompting embeds the AI in real or hypothetical contexts, guiding its responses to simulate decision-making and adaptation to conditions. Examples include asking “How can smart sensors detect and prevent water leakage in urban pipelines?” and “How can self-driving cars prioritize safety when navigating crowded intersections?”—placing the AI into realistic situations to generate actionable insights and potential solutions.[4]

## Comparative Analysis Prompts

Comparative prompts request AI to contrast multiple solutions, processes, or technologies. For predictive maintenance systems, such prompts can guide deeper analysis:
- “Compare the effectiveness of traditional preventive maintenance vs. AI-based predictive maintenance in reducing downtime and costs.”
- “Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of smart sensors vs. manual inspection for urban pipeline leak detection.”
Comparative prompts help clarify the significance of differences and similarities, supporting informed decision-making and strategic recommendations for maintenance optimization.[5][6]

## Prompt Size Limitations

Effective prompt engineering requires understanding AI model token limits; both the prompt and the response consume capacity, so excessive length may truncate the output or miss key details. Techniques like prompt compression—summarizing or removing redundancies—are important in complex case studies to maintain relevance and quality in responses, especially for scenario-based and comparative prompts.[7][8]

## Application Examples

### Predictive Maintenance Experiment Prompts:
- **Scenario Prompt**: “You are the AI in a factory monitoring vibration and temperature data from a set of CNC machines. How would you predict a potential spindle failure and recommend optimal maintenance timing?”
- **Comparative Analysis Prompt**: “Compare the machine learning model’s accuracy in predicting failures using vibration data versus temperature data. Which data source is more reliable for early detection?”
- **Prompt with Size Limit Awareness**: “Summarize the top three diagnostic indicators for spindle failure in under 70 tokens.”

### Urban Water Pipeline Leak Detection:
- **Scenario Prompt**: “Explain how smart sensors installed throughout a city’s water pipeline system could continuously monitor for leaks. What anomalies would trigger an immediate maintenance dispatch?”
- **Comparative Analysis Prompt**: “Contrast the detection speed and cost-effectiveness of smart sensor networks versus periodic manual inspections for leak prevention.”

### Self-Driving Cars at Intersections:
- **Scenario Prompt**: “Describe how a self-driving car’s AI decides its path and speed at a crowded intersection with unpredictable pedestrians.”
- **Comparative Analysis Prompt**: “Analyze the risk assessment differences between rule-based navigation and reinforcement learning-based navigation for safety in urban intersections.”

## Conclusion

By utilizing scenario-based prompting, comparative analysis, and careful prompt sizing, experimenters can generate targeted AI responses that drive actionable insights in predictive maintenance and other complex technical domains.
